## Description

In this scenario, we will review Go's built-in types, primitives, maps, and slices. We will use them to perform some basic operations and 

When you have completed this scenario, you should be able to 
2-3 sentences on what the scenario covers, illustrates, and teaches. What technology is used, and what task will the learner have accomplished by the end?
